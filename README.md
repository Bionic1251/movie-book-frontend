# Movie-book recommender project for software engineering project spring 2023: BookCine

BookCine is a recommender application where the user can rate movies and books and receive movie and book recommendations based on the ratings. There is also features such as:

- Search for a movie or a book based on title, author, an actor, or director

- See similiar books and movies based on the movie/book

- Add movies and books to the wishlist

- See books from the same author

The application is made during University of Helsinki's course [Software engineering project](https://studies.helsinki.fi/opintotarjonta/cur/hy-opt-cur-2223-6f9781fc-bf96-4b48-a0fd-d0472f268989) on spring 2023.

The application is split between two repositories: Frontend (this one) and [Backend](https://github.com/movie-book-recommender/movie-book-backend). The frontend is made using Javascript with React framework and backend is done with Python.
